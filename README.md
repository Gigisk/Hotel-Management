# Hotel Management

**A simple back-end hotel management system that allows users to store and manage information about rooms and customers.**

## Project Overview

This project implements a back-end solution for managing a hotelâ€™s rooms and customer data. It provides a terminal interface where users can interact with the system, store information on rooms, customers, and even update or delete records as needed.

## Features

- **Room Management**  
  - Store details about each room (e.g., occupancy status, number of bedrooms, price/tariff).
  - Add, edit, or remove rooms based on room number.

- **Customer Management**  
  - Store customer details (e.g., name, address, passport ID).
  - Assign customers to specific rooms.
  - Edit or remove customer information as needed.

## How It Works

Upon running the program, the user is prompted to input details for both rooms and customers. The system can:
- Add new rooms or customers
- Edit existing room or customer details
- Delete rooms or customers from the system
- View the current status of rooms and customers
